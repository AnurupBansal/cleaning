# cleaning
The code in the run_analysis.R has been divided into 5 steps. Each step has been separated by an extra line.

Before starting the data cleaning and tidying. I have shown how to extract all the data and given the column names their itself.

Now, I will start explaining each step one by one.

STEP 1 : Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

STEP 2 : Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

STEP 3 : Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
