#CODEBOOK
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The final data set contains the only the mean and standard deviation of the following features : 

 "TimeBodyAccelerometer."                            "TimeGravityAccelerometer."                        
 "TimeBodyAccelerometerJerk."                        "TimeBodyGyroscope."                               
 "TimeBodyGyroscopeJerk."                            "TimeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude."                  
 "TimeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude."                "TimeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude."              
 "TimeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude."                       "TimeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude."                  
 "FrequencyBodyAccelerometer."                       "FrequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk."                  
 "FrequencyBodyGyroscope."                           "FrequencyBodyAccelerometerMagnitude."             
 "FrequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude."          "FrequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude."                 
 "FrequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude."              "Angle.TimeBodyAccelerometerMean.Gravity."         
 "Angle.TimeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean..GravityMean." "Angle.TimeBodyGyroscopeMean.GravityMean."         
 "Angle.TimeBodyGyroscopeJerkMean.GravityMean."      "Angle.X.GravityMean."                             
 "Angle.Y.GravityMean."                              "Angle.Z.GravityMean."

The data has been grouped by each activity performed and there were multiple sets of data for each activity for each volunteer which was summarised by taking out the average.
